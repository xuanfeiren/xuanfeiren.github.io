## Personal Philosophy

**Either read or walk, body and soul, at least one is on the way...** 

I often urge myself to read more and write more to record my current thoughts, and constantly grow in this process. This is also a bottom line of my life, no matter what kind of situation, can not forget to read and write.



## Activities & Interests

- **Hiking**: Completed a 100-kilometer New Year's hike in 28.5 hours! I love traversing through different natural environments, building physical strength while experiencing the beauty of the world. As my friend told me, it's important to feel grounded.
- **Running**: This is the secret to maintaining my high-energy lifestyle.
- **Marathon**: Completed challenging off-road half marathon with 700+ meter elevation gain.
- **Travel**: Aspiring to explore the world and leave footprints everywhere
- **Rock Climbing**: My latest passion! I absolutely love working out and enjoy challenging the impossible. Rock climbing has become an exciting new way for me to push my limits and stay active.
- **Reading & Writing**: Constantly documenting thoughts and experiences for personal growth. I particularly enjoy writing diary entries to reflect on daily experiences and insights.
