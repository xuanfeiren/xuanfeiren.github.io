I love hiking. Completed a 100-kilometer New Year's hike in 28 and a half hours to celebrate arriving of 2021.

This time I completely overcome myself, ended a long time of anxiety, and opened a new stage of my undergraduate life, and also a new stage of my life. From then on, I pursued what I loved, without fear of failure.

I've also been in the school's running club, and I've been in charge of organizing events for a whole year. Running is a sport that makes me forget my troubles and think about what I like.

I mastered a challenging off-road half marathon in Aug. 2023, surmounting a daunting 700+ meter elevation gain.

In addition, I think I also like traveling, but I don't have too much experience. I hope I can see all over the world in the future, so that there are my footprints everywhere.

## Personal Philosophy

**Either read or write, body and soul, at least one is on the way...** I often urge myself to read more and write more to record my current thoughts, and constantly grow in this process. This is also a bottom line of my life, no matter what kind of situation, can not forget to read and write.
