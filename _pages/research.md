My research interests focus on learning theory now, i.e. bandit and reinforcement learning theory. I'm also interested in theoretical statistics. If you are also interested in this field and would like to communicate with me, feel free to contact me.

Because I majored in mathematics and learned a lot of mathematics courses, I tend to do pure theory during my undergraduate study. But I am personally interested in all kinds of directions and hope to try more directions in the future to solve really interesting and meaningful problems.

I am working on projects related to bandit and RL with [Professor Xu](https://panxu-ai.github.io/) from Duke university, and here are some notes on the papers I have read so far.

- This is [reading notes](Reading_Notes.pdf) I took recently. I'm happy to share it. It might be helpful to someone in a related field.
