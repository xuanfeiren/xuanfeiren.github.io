I am currently a PhD student in Computer Science at University of Wisconsin-Madison, advised by [Prof. Tengyang Xie](https://tengyangxie.github.io/). My research focuses on reinforcement learning theory, AI agents, and LLM post-training. I am particularly interested in developing theoretical foundations and practical algorithms for intelligent systems.

My current research spans multiple exciting areas in AI and machine learning, with a focus on both theoretical understanding and practical applications. I am always open to collaborations and discussions about these topics.
