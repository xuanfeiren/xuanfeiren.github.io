I am Xuanfei Ren (任宣霏), a PhD student in Computer Science at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), advised by [Prof. Tengyang Xie](https://tengyangxie.github.io/). I completed my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics (specialization in Probability and Statistics) from the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/) in 2024.

I believe that with dedicated research efforts, the five years of PhD study can be highly productive and meaningful.

## Research Interests

 My current research interests span broadly across AI agents and reinforcement learning, encompassing both theoretical foundations and experimental work. 
 <!-- If you share similar interests, feel free to reach out for a chat! -->

My recent project focuses on leveraging [OpenTrace](https://github.com/AgentOpt/OpenTrace) to optimize AI agents, in collaboration with [Ching-An Cheng](https://www.chinganc.com/) (Google Research) and [Allen Nie](https://anie.me/about) (Google DeepMind). I am designing various efficient search algorithms to achieve optimal performance in agent optimization. This work is open-source, and I encourage everyone in the agent research community to explore and contribute!
